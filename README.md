#Gravity Snap


This is a video game I designed and coded. It is a generalzation of Tetris. In regular Tetris the blocks only travel in the downward direction. I wanted to design a falling block type of game where the blocks travel in any of the four directions. This led to the idea of being able to design your own levels as well.

The game has been accepted to Steam's Greenlight program.
